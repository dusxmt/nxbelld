nxbelld 0.1.2:

    Released on November 7th, 2017, this release includes the following
    improvements:

        - The throttle option was fixed, previously it would only cause a
          delay between the beeps, now it keeps the number of generated
          beeps under control.

        - Switched to a more maintainer-friendly .pod format for the manual
          page.

        - Added links to repositories in the README file.


nxbelld 0.1.1:

    Released on May 30th, 2016, this release was made mainly because of the
    addition of Simon Tatham's more complex waveform beep, which was added in
    xbelld 0.3.5


nxbelld 0.1:

    Released on May 28th, 2016, this is the first release of nxbelld, a heavily
    modified version of Gautam Iyer's xbelld.

    The following are the most significant changes since xbelld 0.3.4:

        - The name was changed to nxbelld, and the version was lowered down
          to 0.1

        - The code was re-structured, an autotools-based build system was
          adapted, the gnulib compatibility library was utilized.

        - Support for the OSS and soundio sound APIs was added. This means that
          nxbelld shouhd work on several BSD systems, including FreeBSD and
          OpenBSD (those two I've tested). The sound API to be used is selected
          by the configure script at compile time.

        - Argument handling is now done by GNU argp. Long options were added.

        - The option of generating a square-wave beep was added.

        - Beeps are now generated at program initialization, instead of each
          time it is to be played.

        - The WAVE file header is now parsed at program initialization, instead
          of each time it is to be played.

        - WAVE files may now contain additional header chunks. They are
          currently simply ignored though.
